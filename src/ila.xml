      <title>Vectors: Algebra and Geometry</title>

      <introduction>
	<note type-name="Primary Goals"> 
          <p> The language of <term>vectors</term> is convenient for doing linear algebra. In this chapter, you should learn:
            <ol>
              <li>What vectors are, and how to do algebra and geometry with vectors;</li>
              <li>What it means to be a <term>linear combination</term> of given vectors;</li>
	      <li>The concept of the <term>span</term> of some vectors, i.e., the set of all linear combinations of these vectors.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          </note>

	 <p> Linear algebra is the study of one or more <term>linear equations</term>, that is, equations that look like
	  <me>2x+3y+5z=1</me>.
	  The basic case of one linear equation in one variable, such as <m>2x=5</m>, is not very interesting. We know that
	  there is a unique solution, and we know how to find it: <m>x=2.5</m>. The complications in linear algebra
	  arise because we consider several simultaneous equations in several variables, for instance
	  <me>
          \syseq{
    3x_1 + 4x_2 + 10x_3 + 19x_4 - 2x_5 - 3x_6 = 141;
    7x_1 + 2x_2 - 13x_3 - 7x_4 + 21x_5 + 8x_6 = 2567;
    -x_1 + 9x_2 + \frac 32x_3 + x_4 + 14x_5 + 27x_6 = 26;
    \frac 12x_1 + 4x_2 + 10x_3 + 11x_4 + 2x_5 + x_6 = -15\rlap.
  }
          </me>
	 </p>
	 <p> In order to discuss systems of equations like this, it will be convenient for us to have notation for
	 keeping track of multiple numbers at once. <term>Vectors</term> provide us with this notation. In the case of
	 vectors with  2 or
	 3 entries, there is a strong connection between vector algebra and geometry. This can be very helpful to
	 us as we develop an intuition for vector algebra, even when there are more than 3 entries.

      <title>Systems of Linear Equations: Algebra</title>

      <introduction>
        <note type-name="Primary Goal">
          <p>Solve a system of linear equations algebraically in parametric form.</p>
        </note>

        <p>
          This chapter is devoted to the algebraic study of systems of linear equations and their solutions.  We will learn a systematic way of solving equations of the form
        <me>
          \syseq{
    3x_1 + 4x_2 + 10x_3 + 19x_4 - 2x_5 - 3x_6 = 141;
    7x_1 + 2x_2 - 13x_3 - 7x_4 + 21x_5 + 8x_6 = 2567;
    -x_1 + 9x_2 + \frac 32x_3 + x_4 + 14x_5 + 27x_6 = 26;
    \frac 12x_1 + 4x_2 + 10x_3 + 11x_4 + 2x_5 + x_6 = -15\rlap.

        <p>
          In <xref ref="systems-of-linear-equations"/>, we will introduce <em>systems of linear equations</em>, the
          class of equations whose study forms the subject of linear algebra.  In <xref ref="row-reduction"/>, will
          present a procedure, called <em>row reduction</em>, for finding all solutions of a system of linear equations.
          In <xref ref="parametric-form"/>, you will see how to express all solutions of a system of linear equations
          in a unique way using the <em>parametric form</em> of the general solution. Finally, in <xref
          ref="matrix-equations"/>, we will learn how to write a system of linear equations succinctly as a matrix
          equation, which looks like <m>Ax=b</m>, where <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix, <m>b</m> is a vector in
          <m>\R^m</m> and <m>x</m> is a variable vector in <m>\R^n</m>.

      <title>Solution Sets and Subspaces</title>

      <introduction>
        <note type-name="Primary Goals">
          <p> We will study two related questions:
            <ol>
              <li>What is the set of solutions to <m>Ax=b</m>?</li>
              <li>What is the set of <m>b</m> so that <m>Ax=b</m> is consistent?</li>
            </ol>
	The first question is the kind you are used to from your first algebra class: what is the set of solutions to <m>x^2-1=0</m>.  The second is also something you could have studied in your previous algebra classes: for which <m>b</m> does <m>x^2=b</m> have a solution?  This question is more subtle at first glance, but you can solve it in the same way as the first question, with the quadratic formula.
          </p>
        </note>

        <p>
          In order to answer the two questions listed above, we will use geometry. This will be analogous to how you
          used parabolas in order to understand the solutions to a quadratic equation in one variable. Specifically,
          this chapter is devoted to the geometric study of two objects:
          <ol>
            <li>the solution set of a matrix equation <m>Ax=b</m>, and</li>
            <li>the set of all <m>b</m> that makes a particular system consistent.</li>
          </ol>
          The first object, the solution set, will be introduced in <xref ref="solution-sets"/>. The second object will be called the column space of <m>A</m>. 
        </p>

	<p>
	Instead of parabolas and hyperbolas, our geometric objects are subspaces, such as lines and planes.  Our
	geometric objects will be something like 13-dimensional planes in <m>\R^{27}</m>, etc.  It is amazing that we
	can say anything substantive about objects that we cannot directly visualize.
	</p>

        <p>
          We will develop a large amount of vocabulary that we will use to describe the above objects. In addition to
	  the concept of the <term>span</term> of a set of vectors from <xref ref="spans"/>,  we will introduce linear independence (<xref ref="linear-independence"/>),
          subspaces (<xref ref="subspaces"/>), dimension (<xref ref="dimension"/>), and bases (<xref ref="dimension"/>
	  and <xref ref="bases-as-coord-systems"/>). Finally, we relate the dimension of the column space of <m>A</m> and the dimension of
	  the solution set to <m>Ax = b</m> (strictly speaking, the solution set to <m>Ax=0</m>) in <xref ref="rank-thm"/>.
