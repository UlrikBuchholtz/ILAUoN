    <title>Vector Equations</title>

    <p>
      <idx><h>Vector equation</h><h>equivalence with system of equations</h></idx>
      An equation involving vectors with <m>n</m> coordinates is the same as <m>n</m> equations involving only numbers.  For example, the equation
    <me>x\vec{1 2 6} + y \vec{-1 -2 -1} = \vec{8 16 3}</me>
    simplifies to
    <me>\vec{ x 2x 6x} + \vec{-y -2y -y} = \vec{8 16 3}
\sptxt{or}
\spalignsysdelims()\syseq{ x - y; 2x - 2y; 6x - y} = \vec{8 16 3}.
    </me>
    For two vectors to be equal, all of their coordinates must be equal, so this is just the system of linear equations
    <me>\spalignsysdelims\{.\syseq{x - y = 8; 2x - 2y = 16; 6x - y = 3\rlap.}</me>
    </p>

    <definition>
      <idx><h>Vector equation</h><h>definition of</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>A <term>vector equation</term> is an equation involving a linear combination of vectors with possibly unknown coefficients.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    
        <bluebox>
      <p>Asking whether or not a vector equation has a solution is the same as asking if a given vector is a linear combination of some other given vectors.  
      </p>
    </bluebox>
    <p>For example the vector equation above is asking if the vector <m>(8,16,3)</m> is a linear combination of the vectors <m>(1,2,6)</m> and <m>(-1,2,-1)</m>.</p>

    <example xml:id="vector-equation-example-unique">
      <statement>
        <p>Consider the vector equation <me>x\vec{1 1 1 2} + y \vec{0 1 1 0} + z \vec{0 0 1 -1} = \vec{3 -2 4 0}.</me> Can you
	find all solutions to this equation? That is, all possible values for numbers <m>x, y, z</m> that make the
	equation true?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p> The vector equation is the same as
	<me>\vec{x x+y x+y+z 2x-z} = \vec{3 -2 4 0}.</me>
	  We can rewrite the vector equation as four equations that each must be true at the same time:
	  <me> x = 3, \qquad x+y=-2, \qquad x+y+z = 4, \qquad 2x-z=0.</me>
	  So we deduce that <m>x=3</m> must be true from the first equation, then <m>y= -2 -3 = -5</m> from the second
	  and so <m>z=4-3+5=6</m> from the third. The values  <m> x = 3,\, y=-5,\, z=6</m> make the fourth equation work
	  out as well. There is a unique solution: <m> x = 3,\, y=-5,\, z=6</m>.
	</p>
	<p> We can also use vector notation to write this solution as 
	<me>\vec{x y z} = \vec{3 -5 6}.</me>
	</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

      <example xml:id="vector-equation-example-not-unique">
      <statement>
        <p>Consider the vector equation <me>x\vec{1 1 1} + y \vec{0 -1 -1} + z \vec{2 0 0} = \vec{3 1 1}.</me>
	Does this vector equation have a solution? Does it have more than one solution?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p> This vector equation has infinitely many solutions. We will solve equations like this more systematically
	later. For now, let's content ourselves with the observation that no matter what value of <m>z</m> we choose,
	setting <m>x=3-2z</m> and <m>y=2-2z</m> yields a solution, because
	<me> (3-2z) \vec{1 1 1} + ( 2-2z) \vec{0 -1 -1} + z \vec{2 0 0} = \vec{3-2z+2z 3-2z-(2-2z) 3-2z-(2-2z)} = \vec{3
	1 1}</me>
	</p>
	<p>For now, this might look a bit like magic. But you can try for yourself what happens if you set
	<m>z=0</m>, <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=2</m> or <m>z=1</m>, <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=0</m>.
	</p>
      </solution>
      </example>

      <specialcase xml:id="vector-equation-example-inconsistent">
              <p>Consider the vector equation <me>x\vec{1 1 1} + y \vec{0 -1 -1} + z \vec{2 0 0} = \vec{1 3 1}.</me>
	Does this vector equation have a solution? Does it have more than one solution?
        </p> 
	<p> This vector equation does not have any solution. We could write it as three separate equations:
	<me>x+2z=1, \qquad x-y=3, \qquad x-y=1,</me>
	which all have to be true at the same time for a solution <m>x, y, z</m>.
	The second equation says <m>x-y=3</m> and the third says <m>x-y=1</m>. These two statements cannot be true at
	the same time, no matter what values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> we choose. So there can be no solution to the
	vector equation.
	</p>
       </specialcase>

      <title>A Picture of a Consistent System</title>
      <idx><h>Vector equation</h><h>consistent</h><see>System of linear equations, consistent</see></idx>

      <idx><h>System of linear equations</h><h>consistent</h><h>picture of</h></idx>
      <p>Below we will show that the above system of equations  is consistent.  Equivalently, this means that the above vector equation  has a solution.  In other words, there is a linear combination of <m>(1,2,6)</m> and <m>(-1,2,-1)</m> that equals <m>(8,16,3)</m>.  We can visualize the last statement geometrically.  Therefore, the following <xref ref="vectors-figure-consistent"/> gives a <em>picture of a consistent system of equations</em>.  Compare with <xref ref="vectors-fig-inconsistent"/> below, which shows a picture of an inconsistent system.
      </p>
           </note>

    
        <figure xml:id="vectors-figure-consistent">
      <caption>A picture of the above vector equation.  Try to solve the equation geometrically by moving the sliders.</caption>
      <mathbox source="demos/spans.html?v1=1,2,6&amp;v2=-1,-2,-1&amp;target=8,16,3&amp;range=20&amp;camera=3,.5,1.5" height="500px"/>
    </figure>



 


    <p>In order to actually solve the vector equation
    <me>x\textcolor{seq-red}{\vec{1 2 6}}
    + y \textcolor{seq-green}{\vec{-1 -2 -1}}
    = \textcolor{seq-blue}{\vec{8 16 3}},</me>
    one has to solve the system of linear equations
    <me>\spalignsysdelims\{.\syseq{x - y = 8; 2x - 2y = 16; 6x - y = 3\rlap.}</me>
    This means forming the augmented matrix
    <me>\def\r{\color{seq-red}}\def\g{\color{seq-green}}\def\b{\color{seq-blue}}
    \amat{\r1 \g-1 \b8; \r2 \g-2 \b16; \r6 \g-1 \b3}</me>
    and row reducing.  Note that <em>the columns of the augmented matrix are the vectors from the original vector equation</em>, so it is not actually necessary to write the system of equations: one can go directly from the vector equation to the augmented matrix by <q>smooshing the vectors together</q>.  In the following <xref ref="vectors-example-consistent"/> we carry out the row reduction and find the solution.
    </p>
    
        <example xml:id="vectors-example-consistent">
      <statement>
        <p>Is <m>\vec{ 8 16 3}</m> a linear combination of <m>\vec{1 2 6}</m> and <m>\vec{-1 -2 -1}</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>As discussed above, this question boils down to a row reduction:
      <me>\amat{1 -1 8; 2 -2 16; 6 -1 3}
      \quad\xrightarrow{\text{RREF}}\quad
      \amat{1 0 -1; 0 1 -9; 0 0 0}.
      </me>
      From this we see that the equation is consistent, and the solution is <m>x=-1</m> and <m>y=-9</m>.  We conclude that  <m>\vec{ 8 16 3}</m> is indeed a linear combination of <m>\vec{1 2 6}</m> and <m>\vec{-1 -2 -1}</m>, with coefficients <m>-1</m> and <m>-9</m>:
      <me>-\vec{1 2 6} -9\vec{-1 -2 -1} = \vec{8 16 3}.
      </me>
      </p>
      </solution>
    </example>



    <bluebox>
      <title>Recipe: Solving a vector equation</title>
      <idx><h>Vector equation</h><h>solving</h></idx>
      <p>In general, the vector equation
      <me>x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_kv_k = b</me>
      where <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k,\,b</m> are vectors in <m>\R^n</m> and <m>x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k</m> are unknown scalars, has the same solution set as the linear system with augmented matrix
      <me>\amat[c]{| | ,{} , | |; v_1 v_2 \cdots, v_k b; | | ,{} , | |}</me>
      whose columns are the <m>v_i</m><rsq/>s and the <m>b</m><rsq/>s.
      </p>
    </bluebox>

    <p>Now we have <em>three</em> equivalent ways of thinking about a linear system:
      <ol>
        <li>As a system of equations:
        <me>\syseq{2x_1 + 3x_2 - 2x_3 = 7; x_1 - x_2 - 3x_3 = 5}
        </me>
        </li>
        <li>As an augmented matrix:
        <me>\amat{2 3 -2 7; 1 -1 -3 5}</me>
        </li>
        <li>As a vector equation (<m>x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_nv_n = b</m>):
        <me>x_1\vec{2 1} + x_2\vec{3 -1} + x_3\vec{-2 -3} = \vec{7 5}</me>
        </li>
      </ol>
    The third is geometric in nature: it lends itself to drawing pictures.  
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Spans</title>

    <p>It will be useful to know what are <em>all</em> linear combinations of a set of vectors <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.  In other words, we would like to understand the set of all vectors <m>b</m> in <m>\R^n</m> such that the vector equation (in the unknowns <m>x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k</m>)
    <me>x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_kv_k = b</me>
    has a solution (i.e. is consistent).
    </p>

    <essential xml:id="vectors-defn-span">

      <statement>
        <p>Let <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>.  The <term>span</term> of <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m> is the collection of all linear combinations of <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m>, and is denoted <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m>.  In symbols:

        We also say that <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is the subset <term>spanned by</term> or <term>generated by</term> the vectors <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m>.

    <p>The above <xref ref="vectors-defn-span"/> is the first of several <em>essential definitions</em> that we will see in this textbook.  They are essential in that they form the essence of the subject of linear algebra: learning linear algebra means (in part) learning these definitions.  All of the definitions are important, but it is essential that you learn and understand the definitions marked as such.
