  <title>Fields and Vector Spaces</title>

  <p>
    In this Appendix we give a brief introduction to the axiomatic theory of
    fields, which underlies the notion of abstract vector spaces.
  </p>

  <p>
    We first give the modern algebraic definition of fields,
  of which the real and complex numbers are the main examples.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>commutative ring</term> is tuple <m>(\Lambda,+,\cdot,-,0,1)</m>
        consisting of
        a set <m>\Lambda</m>, two binary operations <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m>
        of type <m>\Lambda\times\Lambda\to\Lambda</m>,
        a unary operation <m>- : \Lambda\to\Lambda</m>, and two
        constants <m>0,1\in\Lambda</m>,
        satisfying the following laws, for all <m>\lambda,\mu,\nu\in\Lambda</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>
            (\lambda + \mu) + \nu &amp;= \lambda + (\mu + \nu)
            &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(a1)}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \lambda + 0 &amp;= \lambda
            &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(a2)}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \lambda + \mu &amp;= \mu + \lambda
            &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(a3)}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \lambda + (-\lambda) &amp;= 0
            &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(a4)}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            (\lambda\mu)\nu &amp;= \lambda(\mu\nu)
            &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(m1)}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \lambda 1 &amp;= \lambda
            &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(m2)}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \lambda\mu &amp;= \mu\lambda
            &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(m3)}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \lambda(\mu+\nu) &amp;= \lambda\mu + \lambda\nu
            &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(am)}
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        A <term>field</term> is a commutative ring in which every <em>nonzero</em> element
        <m>\lambda</m> has an <em>inverse</em>, i.e., an element <m>\lambda^{-1}</m>
        satisfying <m>\lambda \lambda^{-1} = \lambda^{-1}\lambda = 1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The operation <m>+</m> is called the <term>addition</term>, the operation <m>\cdot</m>
    is called the <term>multiplication</term>, and the operation <m>-</m> is called the
    <term>negation</term> operation of the field. As usual, we leave out the dot
    when writing multiplications.
    To be super precise, we would have to decorate the operations and the constants with
    <m>\Lambda</m> to disambiguate them from the usual ones, as in
    <m>(\Lambda,+_\Lambda,\cdot_\Lambda,-_\Lambda,0_\Lambda,1_\Lambda)</m>.
    The laws (a1) and (m1) are called the <term>associative</term> laws,
    the laws (a2) and (m2) concern the <term>neutral elements</term> <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>,
    the laws (a3) and (m3) are called the <term>commutative</term> laws,
    and the law (am) is called the <term>distributive</term> law.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a consequence of the laws, we can prove other identities, such as <m>1\lambda=\lambda</m>, <m>(\lambda+\mu)\nu = \lambda\nu + \mu\nu</m>, and <m>0\lambda=0</m>,
    for all <m>\lambda,\mu,\nu\in\Lambda</m>. For instance, the last one follows from
    the calculation
    <me>
      0\lambda = (0 + 0)\lambda = 0\lambda + 0\lambda,
    </me>
    together with (a4).
  </p>
  <p>
    It is possible to consider many variations of these axioms, to give possibly
    non-commutative rings, rings without units (<m>1</m>), skew-fields, etc.
    But all the fields laws are familiar from real number arithmetic in <m>\R</m>,
    and they also hold for complex numbers <m>\C</m> (<xref ref="complex-numbers"/>),
    as the reader is invited to check.
    The point of introducing the notion of a field is that all the theorems of
    linear algebra hold over any field and that there are many other examples:
    <ul>
      <li>The rational numbers <m>\Q</m>: the reals numbers of the form <m>p/q</m>
      where <m>q\ne 0</m>.</li>
      <li>More general number fields <m>\Q \subseteq \Lambda \subseteq \C</m>,
      for example <m>\Q(\sqrt{2})</m>,
      the smallest subfield of <m>\C</m> containing a square root of <m>2</m>,
      or the smallest subfield of <m>\C</m> containing a solution to some
      polynomial equation with rational coefficients, etc.
      (This way leads to Galois theory.)</li>
      <li>Finite fields <m>\F_{p^n}</m> with <m>p^n</m> elements,
      where <m>p</m> is a prime number.
      As an example, we can describe a field <m>\F_4</m> with <m>4</m> elements
      <m>0,1,a,a^{-1}</m>, where <m>1+1=0</m> and <m>a^2=a+1</m>.</li>
      <li>The field of rational functions <m>\Lambda(X)</m> over a field <m>\Lambda</m>
      consists of rational functions, i.e., those of the form <m>P/Q</m>,
      where <m>P,Q</m> are polynomials with coefficients from <m>\Lambda</m>
      and <m>Q\ne 0</m>.</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  We can now give the definition of abstract vector spaces.</p>

  <definition>
    <idx><h>Vector space</h><h>definition of</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>A <term>vector space</term> over the field <m>\Lambda</m>
      is a tuple <m>(V,+,\cdot,-,0)</m>
      consisting of
      a set <m>V</m>, binary operations <m>+ : V \times V \to V</m>
      and <m>\cdot : \Lambda \times V \to V</m>,
      a unary operation <m>- : V\to V</m>, and a
      constant <m>0\in V</m>,
      satisfying the following laws, for all <m>x,y,z\in V</m>
      and <m>\lambda,\mu\in\Lambda</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>
          (x + y) + z &amp;= x + (y + z)
          &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(a1)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          x + 0 &amp;= x
          &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(a2)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          x + y &amp;= y + x
          &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(a3)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          x + (-x) &amp;= 0
          &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(a4)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          (\lambda\mu)x &amp;= \lambda(\mu x)
          &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(v1)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lambda (x+y) &amp;= \lambda x + \lambda y
          &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(v2)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          (\lambda + \mu)x &amp;= \lambda x + \mu x
          &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(v3)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          1x &amp;= x
          &amp;&amp;\color{blue}\text{(v4)}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The operation <m>+</m> is again called the <term>addition</term> (of vectrs),
    but the operation
    <m>\cdot</m> is called the <term>scalar multiplication</term>; again, it is usually
    left out of notations.
    These operations allow us to produce linear combinations in a meaningful way,
    and we can prove all the theorems of linear algebra for these,
    at least when they are <term>finite dimensional</term>, i.e.,
    admit a finite ordered basis, as defined in <xref ref="dimension"/>.
    The standard examples are the spaces <m>\Lambda^n</m> of column vectors of
    length <m>n</m>, for any <m>n\in\N</m>. Other examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Vector subspaces (<xref ref="subspaces"/>) of any vector space.</li>
      <li>The set of polynomials
      <me>
        \Lambda[X] = \{\;a_nX^n + \cdots + a_1X + a_0 \mid a_i\in\Lambda\;\}
      </me>
      with the obvious addition and scalar multiplications.</li>
      <li>The set of <m>m\times n</m> matrices over <m>\Lambda</m>
      (<xref ref="matrix-equations" />).</li>
      <li>The set of linear maps <m>f : V \to W</m> between two vector spaces
      over <m>\Lambda</m> (<xref ref="linear-transformations" />).</li>
      <li>The quotient space <m>V/U</m> of a vector space <m>V</m> with respect
      to a subspace <m>U</m>: This is obtained a the quotient of <m>V</m> by the
      equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> defined by <m>x\sim y</m> if and only if
      <m>y-x \in U</m>. The operations are inhered from <m>V</m> in the sense that
      <m>\lambda[x] = [\lambda x]</m> and <m>[x]+[y]=[x+y]</m> are well defined.</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
