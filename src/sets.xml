  <p>
    In this appendix we give a brief review of set notation and lists.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <idx><h>Set</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
	A <term>set</term> is a well-defined collection of objects.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Sets can be specified by listing their elements: <m>\{ a, b, c\}</m> or <m>\{1,2,3,4, \dots \}</m>. They can also be
    specified using <term>set builder</term> notation:
    <me>\{ x \mid x \text{ in } \R, \quad x^2 \le 1\} </me>
    which denotes "the set of all the <m>x</m>s that are real numbers and also satisfy <m>x^2 \le 1</m>. Note that
    <notation><usage>\{\}</usage><description>Set notation</description></notation><m>\{\}</m> braces (also known as "curly
    brackets") are used to denote sets.
  </p>
  
  <p>If <m>S</m> is a set, then the things that are in <m>S</m> are called the <term>elements</term> of <m>S</m>. For
  instance, the elements of <m>\{ a, b, c\}</m> are <m>a,\,b</m> and <m>c</m>. The notation <notation><usage>x \in
  S</usage><description><m>x</m>is an element of <m>S</m></description></notation><m>x \in S</m> is used to indicate
  that <m>x</m> is an element of <m>S</m>. Informally we say "<m>x</m> is in <m>S</m>", but don't confuse this with
  subset notation below.</p>
  
  <p>Two sets are equal if they have the same elements, and
  different otherwise. A consequence of this is that repeating an element or reordering the elements in your
  notation has no effect. Here are three ways of writing the same set:
  <me> \{ a,b,c\} = \{c,a,b\} = \{ a,b,c,a,b,c,a\} </me>.
  </p>

  <p>Suppose <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are sets such that every element of <m>T</m> happens to be an element of <m>S</m> as
  well. Then we say <m>T</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>S</m> (and less often, <m>S</m> is a <term>superset</term>
  of <m>T</m>). We write <m>T \subset S</m>. For instance
  <me> \{ 1, 3, 5, 7, \dots \} \subset \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots \}. </me>
  In practice, people say "<m>T</m> is in <m>S</m>" to describe this as well, even though it is a different sense of
  being "in" from <m>1 \in S</m>. Perhaps they should say "<m>T</m> is contained in <m>S</m>" instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes people use the notation <m>T \subseteq S</m> to denote that <m>T</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>, including
    the possibility that <m>T=S</m>. They also use <m>T \subsetneq S</m> to say that <m>T</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>
    and definitely not equal to it. Therefore the symbol "<m>\subset</m>" becomes ambiguous: which of <m>\subseteq</m>
    or <m>\subsetneq</m> is <m>\subset</m> equivalent to? In most books and papers, <m>\subset</m> and <m>\subseteq</m>
    mean the same thing, but it's best to check if you are in doubt.
