  <p>
    In this appendix we give a brief review of set notation and lists. Set notation is not used in the body
    of the book, but the term <term>set</term> is. It might be helpful to know this notation later.

      <p>
	A <term>set</term> is a well-defined collection of objects.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <p>
    Sets can be specified by listing their elements: <m>\{ a, b, c\}</m> or <m>\{1,2,3,4, \dots \}</m>. They can also be
    specified using <term>set builder</term> notation:
    <me>\{ x \mid x \text{ in } \R, \quad x^2 \le 1\} </me>
    which denotes "the set of all the <m>x</m>s that are real numbers and also satisfy <m>x^2 \le 1</m>. Note that
    <notation><usage>\{\}</usage><description>Set notation</description></notation><m>\{\}</m> braces (also known as "curly
    brackets") are used to denote sets.
  </p>
  
  <p>If <m>S</m> is a set, then the things that are in <m>S</m> are called the <term>elements</term> of <m>S</m>. For
  instance, the elements of <m>\{ a, b, c\}</m> are <m>a,\,b</m> and <m>c</m>. The notation <notation><usage>x \in
  S</usage><description><m>x</m>is an element of <m>S</m></description></notation><m>x \in S</m> is used to indicate
  that <m>x</m> is an element of <m>S</m>. Informally we say "<m>x</m> is in <m>S</m>", but don't confuse this with
  subset notation below.</p>
  
  <p>Two sets are equal if they have the same elements, and
  different otherwise. A consequence of this is that repeating an element or reordering the elements in your
  notation has no effect. Here are three ways of writing the same set:
  <me> \{ a,b,c\} = \{c,a,b\} = \{ a,b,c,a,b,c,a\} </me>.

  <title>Set notations</title>
  <p>Suppose <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are sets such that every element of <m>T</m> happens to be an element of <m>S</m> as
  well. Then we say <m>T</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>S</m> (and less often, <m>S</m> is a <term>superset</term>
  of <m>T</m>). We write <m>T \subset S</m>. For instance
  <me> \{ 1, 3, 5, 7, \dots \} \subset \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots \}. </me>
  In practice, people say "<m>T</m> is in <m>S</m>" to describe this as well, even though it is a different sense of
  being "in" from <m>1 \in S</m>. Perhaps they should say "<m>T</m> is contained in <m>S</m>" instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes people use the notation <m>T \subseteq S</m> to denote that <m>T</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>, including
    the possibility that <m>T=S</m>. They also use <m>T \subsetneq S</m> to say that <m>T</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>
    and definitely not equal to it. Therefore the symbol "<m>\subset</m>" becomes ambiguous: which of <m>\subseteq</m>
    or <m>\subsetneq</m> is <m>\subset</m> equivalent to? In most books and papers, <m>\subset</m> and <m>\subseteq</m>
    mean the same thing, but it's best to check if you are in doubt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are some more pieces of set notation that you are likely to encounter:
    <ul>
      <li>Intersection: If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are two sets, then <m>A \cap B</m>, the <term>intersection</term> of
      <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set that contains exactly the elements that are in <m>A</m> and also in
      <m>B</m>. </li>
       <li>Union: If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are two sets, then <m>A \cup B</m>, the <term>union</term> of
      <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set that contains all the elements that are in <m>A</m> or in <m>B</m> (or
       both). </li>
        <li>Difference: If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are two sets, then <m>A \setminus B</m> (or sometimes <m>A - B</m>),
	the <term>set difference</term> of
      <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set that contains all the elements that are in <m>A</m> but not in
	<m>B</m>. Sometimes people prefer to require <m>B \subseteq A</m> before writing down <m>A \setminus B</m>, but
	it's not necessary. The following is always true: <m> A \setminus B = A \setminus (A \cap B) </m>. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <title>Lists</title>
  <definition>
    <idx><h>List</h></idx>
    <statement><p>a <term>list</term> consists of finitely many entries listed in an order. We will use parentheses <m>(\dots)</m>
    to denote lists, but other notations are possible. </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>The ordering is an
  important part of a list, which is very different from the case of a list. Two lists are equal if and only if they
  contain the same number of terms, and the terms in each position are the same. For instance
  <me> (1,2,3) \neq (3,2,1)</me>
  and
  <me> (1,2,3) \neq (1,2,3,0) </me>
  and
  <me> (1,1,2,2,3,3) \neq (1,2,3,1,2,3) </me></p>

  <p>Each list has an <term>underlying set</term>, consisting of the entries of the list, but now forgetting the order and
  not caring about multiple entries. The examples above show that two lists can be different, even if their underlying
  sets are the same.
